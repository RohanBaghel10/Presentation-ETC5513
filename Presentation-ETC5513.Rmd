* In the sport of association football, a defender is an outfield player whose primary roles are to stop attacks during the game and prevent the opposing team from scoring goals.

* Center backs are usually in pairs, with two full-backs to their left and right, but can come in threes with no full backs.

Two main important characteristics of a defender :
.content-box-soft[
* **Recovery**  - A recovery is recorded at the point where the player of the team beginning the possession touches the ball. 
]
.content-box-soft[
* **Clearance** - When a player kicks the ball away from the goal they are defending. 
]
.content-box-soft[
We will only analyze players who have played more than **50%** of the games, considering consistency is key factor for a 38 matches long league.
]

# Clearance Vs Recovery

* We will be analyzing the data to get the best defender by going through some levels.
* The first and major one being, plotting **Clearance Vs Recoveries** as the these are the two most important characteristics of a defender.


```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/CvsR.png")
```

# Pique Vs Laguardia

* **Pique and Laguardia** came out on top in the first level as they had the most impact as a defender.
* Now we will try to choose the best defender by bringing in more variables into the picture.
