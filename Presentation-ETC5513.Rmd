# Introduction

* La Liga is the Spanish football league and famous for it’s clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. 

* The football leagues provide a great database for accurate statistics. 

* We are analyzing the data from the season 2019-2020.


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/LA-liga.png")

## Research Question 

* In our analysis we have found out the best players in every position ( Defender, Forward, Midfielder, Goalkeeper ). 
.content-box-soft[
* We have taken this data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thegreatcoder/laliga-player-stats).

* The data set contains variables like : Goals scored, Assists, Recoveries, Clearances etc.

* The data contains information about each and every player of the league.

# Defender position 


```{r out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/position.png")
```

* In the sport of association football, a defender is an outfield player whose primary roles are to stop attacks during the game and prevent the opposing team from scoring goals.

* Center backs are usually in pairs, with two full-backs to their left and right, but can come in threes with no full backs.

Two main important characteristics of a defender :
.content-box-soft[
* **Recovery**  - A recovery is recorded at the point where the player of the team beginning the possession touches the ball. 
]
.content-box-soft[
* **Clearance** - When a player kicks the ball away from the goal they are defending. 
]
.content-box-soft[
We will only analyze players who have played more than **50%** of the games, considering consistency is key factor for a 38 matches long league.
]


```{r out.width = '20%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/logo.png")
```

# Clearance Vs Recovery

* We will be analyzing the data to get the best defender by going through some levels.
* The first and major one being, plotting **Clearance Vs Recoveries** as the these are the two most important characteristics of a defender.


```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/CvsR.png")
```

class: left, middle
# Pique Vs Laguardia

* **Pique and Laguardia** came out on top in the first level as they had the most impact as a defender.
* Now we will try to choose the best defender by bringing in more variables into the picture. 


```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/PvsL.png")
```

# Who has made more mistakes?

* Now we will be judging the players on the number of mistakes made by them as they are giving each other a tough competition.

```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/worse.png")
```

* As we can clearly see Laguardia has made significantly more mistakes while on the pitch, **Pique** is defender who wins this competetion.

* On top of of that pique has also scored 4 goals for .blue[FC] .red[BARCELONA]

# Position: Forward

### The aim of this section is to analyse which player is the best in the *Forward position* in the LaLiga Tournament based on data from 2019-2020. 

.content-box-purple[
A Forward is an attacking player who plays nearest to the opposing team's goal and is most responsible for scoring goals for their team.
]
---
```{r Filter-Data, echo = FALSE}
Forward <- La_liga_data %>%
  filter (Position == "Forward")

Forward <- Forward %>%
  select(Team, Name, Games.played, Yellow.Cards, Goals.scored, Penalties.scored, Successful.tackles, Recoveries, Successful.duels, Assists, Interceptions, Recoveries, Successful.aerial.challenges) %>%
  rename("Games_played" = Games.played,
         "Yellow_cards" = Yellow.Cards,
         "Goals_scored" = Goals.scored,
         "Penalties_scored" = Penalties.scored,
         "Successful_tackles" = Successful.tackles,
         "Successful_duels" = Successful.duels,
         "Successful_aerial_challenges" = Successful.aerial.challenges)
```
## Analysis of goals, penalties and assists

Goals Scored, Penalties Scored and Assists account for the most successful outcome given by a player in the Forward position.

```{r Goals-Analysis, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Forward <- Forward %>%
  mutate(goals_per_game = ((Goals_scored + Penalties_scored + Assists)/Games_played)) %>%
  arrange(desc(goals_per_game)) %>%
  mutate(Goal_rank = 1:94)

Forward_Goal <- Forward %>%
  slice_head(n=5) %>%
  select(Team, Name, goals_per_game, Goal_rank) %>%
  kable(caption = "Top 5 forward position players for goals per game") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")

Forward_Goal
```

Messi from Team FC Barcelona holds the first rank in this analysis with an average of 1.55 goals per match.

## Analysis of success scores

The variables used for this analysis are:

.purple[.bold[Successful tackles]], .purple[.bold[Successful duels]] and .purple[.bold[Successful aerial challenges]]
```{r Success-Scores, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Forward <- Forward %>%
  mutate(success_score = (Successful_tackles + Successful_duels + Successful_aerial_challenges)/Games_played) %>%
  arrange(desc(success_score))  %>%
  mutate(Score_rank = 1:94)

Forward_Score <- Forward  %>%
  slice_head(n=5) %>%
  select(Team, Name, success_score, Score_rank) %>%
  kable(caption = "Top 5 forward position players for Success Score") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")

Forward_Score
```
---
## Plotting Goals vs Success Score
```{r goals-v-success, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(Forward, aes(x=success_score, y = goals_per_game, label = Name)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Success Score", y = "Goals") +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_text_repel(size = 3)
```
.purple[ The players that occur on the top right corner are so far the top players in our analysis.]

## Penalising players for high yellow cards
```{r Yellow-cards, fig.cap = "Top 20 yellow card players", fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Forward_yellow <- Forward %>%
  select(Team, Name, Yellow_cards) %>%
  arrange(desc(Yellow_cards)) %>%
  slice_head(n=20)

ggplot(Forward_yellow) + geom_col(aes(y=Yellow_cards, x=fct_reorder(Name, Yellow_cards)), fill = "#F6BE00") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(x= "Name", y= "Yellow Cards", title = "Highest yellow card players")
```

## Top 5 players

.pull-left[
```{r Top, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Forward_top <- Forward %>% anti_join(Forward_yellow) %>%
  mutate(rank = (Goal_rank + Score_rank)/2) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  select(Team, Name) %>% 
  slice_head(n=5)

Forward_top <- Forward_top %>% slice_head(n=5) %>%
  kable(caption = "Top 5 forward position players") %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center")

Forward_top
```
]

.pull-left[
The table displays the top 5 forward position players in the LaLiga Tournament according to the 2019-2022 data on the basis of their goals, assists, successful duels and tackles per game and after removing the players with high number of yellow cards. **[Messi from FC Barcelona](figs/messi.jpeg)** is at the top of the list followed by M. Gómez, Jorge Molina, Williams and Enric Gallego.

# Conclusion

After analyzing the data we have found the following :

* **G. Pique** from FC Barcelona is the best **defender**.

* **Lionel Messi** from FC Barcelona is the best **forward**.
